However, the atmosphere of war is still there: the central part of his native small town is controlled by the Soviets, while the surroundings are controlled by partisan fighters. Josef gets trapped between those two forces: Soviets demand him to become their agent, and partisans - their double agent. In order to survive, he has to agree with both. Josef\'s relationship with the chief partisan fighter, Vlad, is particularly complex. They\'ve known each other since childhood. Vlad was never pleasant or kind, but Josef once saved Vlad\'s dog and that\'s how he\'s earned Vlad\'s favor. However, according to the recent gossip, Vlad\'s men were responsible for the death of Josef parents. The Soviets lodge Josef in a house allegedly connected to the partisan fighters, a house that belonged to Vlad\'s lover, Jane. Even though Jane is madly in love with Vlad, and has been acting cold and reserved with Josef, he develops special feelings to her. Jane becomes pregnant from Vlad and they throw a secret wedding. Afterward, the guests, made up of partisan fighters, begin sneaking out of the house. But the police ambush them, and Josef becomes the suspect and the target of Vlad\'s impending revenge. Meanwhile, the Soviets proceed with their ruthless policy, forcing the families of the deceased partisan fighters into exile. Jane, the infamous bride, is also on the list. Driven by compassion and love, Josef tries to save her. The police assume Josef to be the father of the unborn child and since he works for them, Jane is set free. This complex love triangle culminates in Vlad sneaking in to take revenge for the alleged betrayal by Josef. But instead, he finds his wife alive and safe and falls on his knees in gratitude, asking Josef for forgiveness and begging him to take care of his unborn child. Time goes by and Josef takes care of Jane as if she was his own wife and nurses the newborn all by himself. When the child starts calling him his father, Josef realizes he\'s become trapped again: feelings for his new family are stronger than the fear of being shot. Josef and Jane\'s repressed feelings explode in passion but not for long. Many years pass. Official letters reach Josef in Israel. He\'s asked to testify in the case of Vlad, who is being prosecuted for mass shootings of the Jews. Josef hesitates: he needs to decide whether to testify with the truth that will have Vlad executed, or to lie that will save the real father of a child.'),(182,'Egise Taara Juvvalu','[\"Kamal Krishna Annarapu\", \" Darbha Appaji Ambarisha\", \" Abhay Bethiganti\"]','Mahesh Kathi','Mahesh Kathi',4.8,'[\"Drama\"]','2017-11-14','95 min','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjhmMTQ2NjctNmUyZi00ZjYyLTg1NGYtZDk5MTBhNGQ0NmUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDc2NzU1MTA@._V1_SX300.jpg','Egise Tarajuvvalu revolves around the class of 30 underprivileged school kids and how their life changes when Manasa (Sowmya Venugopal) joins as their new Science teacher.'),(183,'Bikers Kental 2','[\"Zizan Razak\", \" Awie\", \" Julangtip Sukkasem\"]','Helmi Yusof','Nurul Salajuddin, Helmi Yusof',6.9,'[\"Action\", \" Adventure\", \" Comedy\"]','2019-03-14','94 min','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGY4ZjM1YjYtMjM4OC00NDYzLWI4NjktYzQzMGIzNzNlZjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzYxOTQ3MDg@._V1_SX300.jpg','Bidin Al Zaifa is madly in love with a Thai woman named Cherry Porntit.

The Mountain Minor is the story of a life-worn Charlie Abner, a generation later, as he struggles with leaving his present life and family in Ohio to return to the Kentucky mountain home and musical heritage that once defined him. The story is partially told in flashbacks to depression era Eastern Kentucky, when Charlie\'s parents, Oza and Vestal Abner, face the difficult decision to leave the way of life they know and move to Ohio for employment and better opportunities.

Among the more likable features here is the initial setup and premise to be had here with the legendary curse that prowls the area. Taking the idea of the creatures\' presence as the evidence of a curse falling over the town regarding it being alive in hibernation until a blood-red moon arises bringing it out to stalk and kill victims as sacrifices only to return back into hibernation and protect the town afterward, it adds a fun old-school dynamic to the storyline involving ancestral curses and protection spells gone awry. The normal structural points here with the outcast who knows everything to stop it, the disbelieving authorities who are slow on the take until it\'s too late and the big confrontation at the end, this one comes off quite nicely. As well, the film also manages to get a lot of fun from the creature attacks which are rather entertaining indie-style ambushes. Focusing on the blood-red tint on the camera for the creatures\' movements through the area during the stalking scenes, the fact that it comes out of nowhere and brings about either a brief sudden shock ambush where it graphically tears victims apart or engages in a short but frantic chase through the community, these are both in abundance throughout here. With the second half bringing about more attacks with the creature getting more ambitious and bold, it all leads into the final confrontation in the woods where the unconventional ending has a lot to like. Combined with the fun gore and some cheesy indie charm to the creature itself, there are some enjoyable factors here. There are some minor issues at play with the film. The main issue is the films\' inability to play off the aspects of the curse as something that the viewer is already aware of. Although the characters in the film are already well-aware of its impact over town and what it details, the fact that they treat everything like it\'s all common knowledge before it\'s spelled out to the audience means their conversations go in circles rather cryptically without spelling out what\'s happening. Although it gets fixed eventually, this is a surprisingly distracting aspect of the film early on. The other factor here is the obvious budgetary limitations that arise which include stock footage of a different movie for no reason, limited locations, and special effects which all highlight this feature but don\'t drag it down that badly.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.'),(340,'Until You','[\"Tran Thanh\", \" Nguy Thien An\", \" Will\"]','Tuan Vu Dinh','Duc Thinh',4.5,'[\"Comedy\", \" Drama\", \" Romance\"]','2016-12-30','100 min','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY4YzNhNDgtYjU0Mi00MmU3LTlmZjgtMzY3ZjBhNDNhZjZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTIxNDQ1MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg','A magical encounter leaves a young woman with a dog that must help her romance a pop star in order to transform back into a human.'),(341,'Apex Predators','[\"Brinke Stevens\", \" Vida Ghaffari\", \" Dawna Lee Heising\"]','Dustin Ferguson','Dustin Ferguson',1.5,'[\"Horror\"]','2021-05-11','75 min','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk3MTMyMWMtNTU5NC00Y2FkLTliZWMtY2JiYzM0YzVhM2NiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwNjY3MTY@._V1_SX300.jpg','The bodies of beach goers begin washing ashore during the grand opening of a new resort with dire results.'),(342,'In a Silent Way','[\"Nicolai Dorian\", \" Kimball Farley\", \" Dillon J Stücky\"]','Collin Levin','Nicolai Dorian, Collin Levin, Nicholas Tuttle',7.8,'[\"Comedy\"]','2022-06-17','93 min','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxOTc5YjUtMTI2ZC00ZTY2LTk0YTEtM2NmMWZhYWRhZjM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY0NzMwODg@._V1_SX300.jpg','In A Silent Way centers around a young jazz guitarist, Jazzen Goodman, who dreams of becoming a jazz legend.

However, it is largely unknown that only a short time later, the ideas and demands of the 68ers should manifest themselves in another youth movement. In the early 1970s, thousands of young people in West Germany tried to establish self-governing youth centers in their towns and cities in order to create their own meeting places for leisure activities without a compulsion to buy and without being controlled by the parent generation. With slogans like \"What we want: free time without control\", they took to the streets collecting signatures and arguing with local politicians. Following the 1968 revolt, youth initiative groups had formed in a large number of cities and towns. With the youth center movement and the establishment of hundreds of self-governing youth centers, political and cultural upheavals also took place in the \"countryside\", and the politicized youth culture of the time spread in rural, suburban and urban areas.

The next mini-film is relatively heavy drama, and plays out during one late night, with Mastandrea playing a husband whose wife (Valentina Cervi) pries and pries and pries until he spills every detail about an affair he had. In another short, Scamarcio is a salesman on the road, in a hotel for a conference; he thinks he\'s suave, tells jokes that make the listeners feel as if they\'re in prison, and hits on anything that moves. He eventually ends up in a co-worker\'s room, desperately cajoling her to sleep with him. He\'s very grabby which is very \"funny\" (read: not funny) and a laughingstock among the other salespeople - Mastandrea is one of them, who actually succeeds with the ladies - but he either isn\'t aware or doesn\'t care. The next short stars Mastandrea as a sad bald man who routinely visits the glory hole at a local brothel - yes, until his wife (Marina Fois) begins to suspect something\'s up.

They produce their work cheaply thanks to new software, and they spread their concerns rapidly over the Internet. In their music, they demand a new role for Africa in today\'s world, strengthen women\'s self-confidence, combat environmental pollution, and teach their peers self-acceptance, self-confidence, and self-esteem. They reflect on alternative lifestyles and new career paths and contradict the mainstream views of neighbors, ministers, and the omnipresent priests in the numerous mega churches in their country.In the collaboration with these Ghanaian artists, it becomes clear that anyone who wants to change something is walking a fine line between creativity, anger, exhaustion, and depression.

Their lives collide when Ejikeme an investment banker comes home from the United States with Lola\'s brother Charlie to invest in Nigerian businesses. It is love at first sight for them and as they embark on a journey of discovering this new love, they have to contend with the political ambitions of Ejikeme\'s mother who is planning a marriage between him and the only daughter of Otunba Ayodeji, a political juggernaut who is considering Ejikeme\'s father as his running mate for the Nigerian Presidency. His mother\'s actions create a rift between Ejikeme and Lola that pits their families against one another with almost deadly results. Ejike\'s mother is a driven social butterfly with just one aim in mind, make her husband President and become the First Lady. Lola\'s mother is a psychologist with a cool temperament but she is pushed too far when her daughter is threatened. As the love story of Ejikeme and Lola unfolds, viewers will laugh, cry and root for true love all at once.In \"2 Weeks in Lagos\" we witness the impact of superstitions on the Nigerian mind when a father tries to kill his young daughter who he has accused of being a demon child (Ogbanje in the local parlance), claiming she is the reason for his depressed business and his wife\'s sickness that had been going on since she was born. When he is stopped from doing this by Lola and her tailor Madam Eloho, he dumps the child on Madam Eloho and leaves without a backward glance. In Madam Eloho, the elasticity of the Nigerian psyche in dealing with difficulties is fully displayed as she takes on the child without giving it any though and declares that \"God will help us\" when Lola questions her about being able to provide for the child.\"2 Weeks in Lagos\" captures the excitement and vibrancy of everyday life in Lagos and reflects the complexity of life in Lagos, a dynamic city where anything is possible in 2 Weeks. Through out the story, Nigerian traditions are explored in an authentic manner that is exciting, educative and poignant; biblical truths about mercy, love, and forgiveness are explored and naturally woven into the day-to-day lives of the protagonists in a truthful and respectful manner reflecting the deep faith of the typical Nigerian. From the crippling infamous Lagos traffic, to the daily hustle that makes up life on the streets of Lagos and a visit to the local street food vendors (Bukkas) serving up the best in local delicacies, \"2 Weeks in Lagos will keep viewers glued to the screen from beginning to end.'),(829,'Dakota','[\"Abbie Cornish\", \" William Baldwin\", \" Tim Rozon\"]','Kirk Harris','Johnny Harrington',5.4,'[\"Family\"]','2022-04-01','96 min','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZThjOWI1NjctMDJkZi00ODJlLTg2ODQtZmExOTY5YTI4ZDkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzODcxNDM@._V1_SX300.jpg','Single Mom and recently widowed Kate Sanders (Abbie Cornish) lives on her family\'s farm in Georgia with her daughter Alex (Lola Sultan).

Loosely based upon Goethe\'s source material (very much recommended if not familiar with it), the story is compelling if old-fashioned. Even better is Gounod\'s music which is beyond incredible, so many jewels to pick from.Found 2019\'s Royal Opera House production of \'Faust\' to be excellent, even if not completely perfect. For anybody getting into opera or new to opera, \'Faust\' and this production serve as a good introduction, and they are not even the best that opera can offer. Did very much enjoy the 2004 production while not liking all the staging, but find this revival to be even better. What didn\'t quite work for me before had just about grown on me, while finding a couple of things not noticed before that could easily have not been there and nobody would have noticed. Actually consider the production one of the best of the 2018/2019 season and one of the better productions of \'Faust\' seen.Not all the staging touches work, the cabaret part added very little to nothing and felt out of place. The touch with Christ also didn\'t make sense and could easily have been ommited.Have nothing to criticise otherwise. The town scenes worked much better for me this time, more rousing and the \'Les Miserables\'-like feel didn\'t feel as distracting. Still think Mephistopheles\' costume in the Walpurgis Night scene (the first half of Act 5) is on the bizarre side but it just about fitted the atmosphere. Even if there have been questionable staging touches in other productions of his, McVicar\'s work has always been interesting and on the most part tastefiul, always making an effort to be respectful to the opera in question while adding new touches to the drama, character interaction and characters that make them more interesting. Though there has always been more room for risk-taking.This can all be seen here. \"Salut Demure Chaste et pure\" and the Jewel song are neither cluttered or static, neither with needless staging touches. The final trio has intensity (same with the duel scene) and ends on a poignant note, while there are amusing and menacing touches with Mephistopheles (the mocking serenade especially) and the church scene is beautifully performed. A standout is the Walpurgisnacht ballet, am always delighted when it is included because it not always is, which is both sexy and oddly terrifying. The production is very well done visually, with the glitz in some scenes and grittiness in others never overdone, and the lighting is a big star, especially in the Walpurgisnacht scene where the austerity is nailed. Beautifully captured when live screened in the cinema.Musically, this \'Faust\' is superb. The power, darkness, lyricism, finesse and nuance of the score are brought out expertly by the well-balanced orchestra. The chorus sing beautifully and there are constant signs of individuality in their acting, don\'t know about you but with the right director acting has come on a lot in opera. Dan Ettinger\'s conducting is alert and sympathetic. There is not a weak link in the cast. Michael Fabiano is an ardent Faust while also having the right amount of intensity in his acting, his voice having a nice ring and didn\'t sound too small for the role. Irina Lungu, now recovered having been ill for some of the run, has a shimmering tone most obvious in the Jewel song (she handles the colouratura with ease) and the fragility and steel of Marguerite are beautifully conveyed. Stephane Degout is a firmly acted and warmly sung Valentin, with \"Avant de Quitter\" being a production high point. Marta Fontanals-Simons is a touching Siebel. The best performance came from Erwin Schrott in a performance one will remember for a long time, who sings magnificently and is equally magnificent in characterising and balancing the swagger, comic timing (he is very funny sometimes) and menace (also genuinely terrifying in others) of Mephistopheles.Overall, excellent. 9/10'),(832,'Births, Deaths and Marriages','[\"Ariadne Baltazar\", \" Paul Barrett\", \" Terry Binding\"]','Beatrice Joblin','Beatrice Joblin',6.7,'[\"Comedy\", \" Drama\"]','2019-07-28','73 min','https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NmNDBkZGItNWY1NC00NTg0LWI0MTMtYzE5Nzk3ZmRjOGEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg5MDkzMDA@._V1_SX300.jpg','One family.

The film explores the shattered lives, emotional and psychological turmoil of the family members whose relatives were barbarically murdered by Emwazi. It also projects the astonishingly self-critical evaluations by CIA, Scotland Yard, and Pentagon officials who expose their own failures in the fight against ISIS and why the organisation was allowed to exist and spread its poisonous ideology in the first place.
